## Noughts and Crosses with React

### Objectives

1. To think carefully about the data that will be underlying your front-end user interface
2. To continue improving your understanding of React
3. To understand the benefit of separating your React components into separate modules
4. To learn how to test React components
5. To introduce the need for a bundler for more complex projects and a better development workflow (we will be using webpack)
6. To refresh your understanding of the package.json file
7. To work on your HTML and CSS skills

### Stages

1. Spend some time thinking carefully about what data you will need for your application. Imagine the two players are playing side by side at the same screen, simply taking turns
2. Create the stateless components you will need to render the Noughts and Crosses board on the screen
3. Consider where to keep the state of your application and how you will pass it down to the components that need it.
4. Give thought to how turns will work in your game (x always goes first), and to what happens when there is a winner, a tie, or when someone wants to reset the board.
5. Style your game so that someone would really want to play it!
